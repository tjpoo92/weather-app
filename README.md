### Retrospective

This project was extremely enjoyable to work on. I enjoy doing and working on API calls and it was fun learning how to handle the incoming data and structure it in a way that worked for the way I wanted to present the data. I also found the user interface of this project easier to do than other projects I've worked on since the elements of it were primarily informational instead of being functional.

#### Things to improve upon:
- Search functionality is limited and doesn't handle errors other than to tell the user to include their country code
- Coverting temperature can occasionally stop working
